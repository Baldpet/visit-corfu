# __Visit Corfu__

## __Aim of the Site__

The island of Corfu is beautiful in many ways throughout most of the year.  
I also have a personal investment to the island as it is where part of my family resides.  
Therefore I wanted to focus the project upon it to raise its awareness and its tourism.

## __UX__

The aim for the user experience of the site was to be a branch site of Greek Tourism centering on the Greek island of Corfu.  
The idea is that it should encourage people who visit the site to ultimately look to visit Corfu Island itself and drive Tourism as a whole to Greece.

The project itself will look to highlight places to visit and what is on offer in different times in the year.

### __Client Stories__

The next part of the project will look at different users of the site, what they want to acheive on the site and how the site caters for them to do this.

#### Client 1
* Somebody who is looking for a holiday destination to book for a future holiday.
  * The main functuality that the site needs to service is what activities are on offer and when is the best time to visit to persuade them to visit.
  * The site aims to deliver this by concentrating on the two main times in the year to visit (Easter and Summer) as well as places of interest to visit.
  * The site also allows the visitor to enquire for further information.

#### Client 2
* Somebody who is already on holiday in Corfu and they are looking for places to visit.
  * In this case the client will not be interested in the times of the year to visit as they are already there. However they may be interested in places to visit and how to book tickets.
  * The site aims to deliver this but offering a quick reference to main historical and other places to visit, with an equiry contact form to look at booking.

### __Wireframes__

To begin the planning of how the site would look I put together a series of wireframes inlcuded below.  
During the design process there was a decision made to create the site over multiple pages rather than a scrolling one page site.  
The reason for this was to limit the length of each page on mobile format and also to make it easy to navigate to where the client wanted to get to quickly.

* CSS 3
    * For the styling and beauty of the webpages
* Bootstrap 4
    * Was used as a base for the structure using the grid system.

## __Deployment__

There were a number of steps taken to deploy the website onto GitHub Pages.

1. The code was written on an online IDE - Gitpod.
2. The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored on a public repository.
3. Under the settings section of the GitHub repository there is a sub-heading of GitHub Pages.
4. In this section the master brach of the project has been selected.
5. Then the publish to GitHub Pages button was pressed to publish the site onto Github Pages.

There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

The code can be run locally through clone or download.  
By opening the repository and and being in the main 'code' section there is a button 'clone or download'.  
This button will provide a link that you can use on your desktop or download as a ZIP file.
