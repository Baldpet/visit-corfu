# __Visit Corfu__

## __Aim of the Site__

The island of Corfu is beautiful in many ways throughout most of the year.  
I also have a personal investment to the island as it is where part of my family resides.  
Therefore I wanted to focus the project upon it to raise its awareness and its tourism.

## __UX__

The aim for the user experience of the site was to be a branch site of Greek Tourism centering on the Greek island of Corfu.  
The idea is that it should encourage people who visit the site to ultimately look to visit Corfu Island itself and drive Tourism as a whole to Greece.
